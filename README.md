# Smart-Rebounder

## Developers: Anjan Amarnath, Russell Wakugawa, Jeff Cui, Joseph Powell, Lucia Zhang, Kevin Hernandez, Prathik Rao

The Smart Rebounder will be a basketball hoop attachment that funnels made baskets back in the direction of the shooter no matter their position on the court. It'll use OpenCV to track the shooter's position and programatically rotate the attachment to funnel the basketball back in the shooter's direction.
