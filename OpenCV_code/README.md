## OpenCV-related code

Follow instillation steps:

Windows: https://solarianprogrammer.com/2016/09/17/install-opencv-3-with-python-3-on-windows/
Mac: https://medium.com/@nuwanprabhath/installing-opencv-in-macos-high-sierra-for-python-3-89c79f0a246a

The Mac installation says to use virtual environments. After I installed opencv to my machine, I was able to run opencv with python locally without a virtual environment.
